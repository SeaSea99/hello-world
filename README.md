# hello-world
The first repository

So emmm... This is my first sentence, and I don't know waht to say as a tradition hhh.
But I am happy to find a place here, that maybe I can write something about myself. Maybe luckily, we will see it~

So at this moment, I am trying to balancing my time between studying and chasing after a beautiful girl.
I wish I'll move her heart by accompanying with her in my leisure time, but I also have to remember that don't devote your heart into chasing!
Remember to balance your time !
